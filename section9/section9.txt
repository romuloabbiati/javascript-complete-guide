- What are objects?

- Objects are a core data structure in JAVASCRIPT.
- Typically reflect real-world entities.
	- e.g. button, movie.

- an object in JavaScript is made up of properties & methods

- there are 2 type of values in JS: PRIMITIVE VALUES & REFERENCE VALUES 
(= OBJECTS)

Primitive values: numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined, symbol
Reference values (=objects): is everything else, e.g.,  DOM node is an 
object, array is an object, things that I create on my own with { ... }, 
other built-in objects.
