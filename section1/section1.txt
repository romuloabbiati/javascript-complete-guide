SECTION 1
What is JavaScript?
- JS is a dynamic, weakly typed programming language which is compiled 
at runtime. It can be executed as part of a webpage in a browser or 
directly on any machine ("host environgment").
- JS interpreted language, "on the fly" compiled language.
- "Hosted language". It runs in different environments (e.g. in 
browser).
- Most prominent use-case: run code in a browser (on a webpage).
- Dynamic, weakly-typed programming language.

How JavaScript is executed?
If we are running a JS code into the browser, the browser has something 
called engine; the engine is responsible to parse code, compile 
this code to machine code and then execute the machine code. The effect 
you will see is the webpage being rendered on screen.
The engine and/or the processor runs JS on a single thread.

Dynamic? Weakly typed?
dynamic means that JS is not pre-compiled, instead is parsed and compiled 
on the fly (e.g. in the browser). Code evaluated and executed at runtime. 
Code can change at runtime (e.g. type of a variable). I can store a text 
in a variable and then at a later time I can update it to a number. The 
same is not allowed on other programming languages.
Weakly typed means that when we work with data in JS, for ex. text data 
or numbers, you don't have to tell JS that I'm going to work with a text 
now or I'm going to work with a number now.

JavaScript Runs on a host environment
JS can be run in the browser and also on server-side (like Java & PHP).
Running JS in the browser means I can manipulate HTML and CSS files, 
and also send background HTTP requests, but I can't access the local 
fylesystem for security reasons. If I run JS as Node.js, i.e. on 
server-side, I can access the filesystem but I can't manipulate 
HTML and CSS.
CLIENT-SIDE (BROWSER) / SERVER-SIDE (NODE.JS)
