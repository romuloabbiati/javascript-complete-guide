SECTION 1
What is JavaScript?
- JS is a dynamic, weakly typed programming language which is compiled 
at runtime. It can be executed as part of a webpage in a browser or 
directly on any machine ("host environgment").
- JS interpreted language, "on the fly" compiled language.
- "Hosted language". It runs in different environments (e.g. in 
browser).
- Most prominent use-case: run code in a browser (on a webpage).
- Dynamic, weakly-typed programming language.

How JavaScript is executed?
If we are running a JS code into the browser, the browser has something 
called engine; the engine is responsible to parse code, compile 
this code to machine code and then execute the machine code. The effect 
you will see is the webpage being rendered on screen.
The engine and/or the processor runs JS on a single thread.
