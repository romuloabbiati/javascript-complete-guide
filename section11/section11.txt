SECTION 11 - Deep Dive: Constructor Functions & Prototypes

- in the past JS didn't have Classes, it is a quite new feature.
- Instead JS had something called CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTIONS; in the end what Classes do 
It uses Constructor functions.
- Constructor functions are used as a blueprint for Objects, and also used to instantiate 
Properties and Methods and so far is the same as Classes.

Current we use a class as a blueprint to create objects:

class Person {
	name = 'Romulo';

	constructor() {
		this.age = 37;
	}

	greet() {
			console.log(
				`Hi my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old`
			)
	}
}

PREVIOUSLY

function Person() {
	this.name = 'Romulo';
	this.age = 37;
	this.greet = function() {
		console.log(
			`Hi my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old`
		)
	}
}
